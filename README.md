# Hand Gesture Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV
This repository contains a hand gesture detection system built using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The project uses a custom GestureDetector class to identify hand gestures from live video input. The application can detect single and multi-hand gestures and label them on the screen in real-time. It also has one fun interactive feature: controlling the volume using hand gestures in Windows.

# Features
1. Real-Time Hand Detection: Leverages MediaPipe to detect hands from a live webcam feed.
2. Gesture Recognition: Identifies predefined gestures using custom thresholding based on angles and distances.
3. Bounding Boxes and Labels: Draw bounding boxes around detected hands and label them with the identified gesture.
4. Flexible Gesture Modes: Supports both single and dual-hand gesture modes.

Detect hand gestures on streams. Now, it can detect 18 pre-defined hand gestures, including Chinese numbers 1 - 10, 'OK', 'Thumbs-up', 'Thumbs-down', 'Rock', 'Claw', 'C shape', 'O shape', and 'Pinch'.
